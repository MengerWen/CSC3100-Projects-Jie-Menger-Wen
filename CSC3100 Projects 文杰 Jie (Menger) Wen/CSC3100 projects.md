Here are all the codes and reports of my 4 Projects in the CSC3100 course. All Projects are implemented using Python. The scores of my four Projects are all full marks.

These tasks involve a mix of array manipulation, algorithm design (especially with trees, queues, and graphs), and efficiency optimizations, showcasing problem-solving and coding proficiency in data structures.

# Project1
1. **Array Problem**:
    - **Task**: Implement a sequence of operations on an array of integers, including updating elements based on a formula, querying the sum of the array, and determining the maximum number of distinct values after flipping signs of elements. Efficient processing is required due to large input constraints.
2. **List Problem**:
    - **Task**: Given a permutation of integers, determine whether a sequence of operations can generate a specific set of values by splitting arrays and determining if the permutation is valid.
# Project2
1. **Queue Problem**:
    - **Task**: Minimize the number of deletions required to make a list match the list of indices, ensuring that the list contains only elements corresponding to their positions.
2. **Time Complexity**:
    - **Task**: Calculate the time complexity of programs in a new programming language, analyzing loop structures and handling nested loops while maintaining variables appropriately for time complexity calculations.
# Project3
1. **Tree Problem**:
    - **Task**: Given a tree with nodes and edges, determine the minimum health points required for a warrior to traverse from any leaf to the root while managing their magic and health points.
2. **Maximum Subinterval Sum Problem**:
    - **Task**: Find the maximum sum of a subinterval of items on shelves, under the constraints that the number of items from each shelf must be unequal and items must be taken continuously.
# Project4
1. **Mirror Problem**:
    - **Task**: For each of several path queries, find the shortest possible path that passes through a set of specified edges in an undirected graph, taking traversal times into account.
2. **Violet Problem**:
    - **Task**: In a dynamic graph where edge weights change over time, calculate the maximum number of violets encountered on the shortest path between two nodes for multiple days.
3. **Hero Problem**:
    - **Task**: Given a graph where paths reduce health and spirit points based on monster attacks, calculate the minimum initial health points needed for a hero to reach a destination.
